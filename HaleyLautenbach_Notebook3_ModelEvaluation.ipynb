    "There are many movie recommendation systems or streaming services that allow for users to set up a profile. This profile then adds information to the system about what types of films the user does and doesn't like, allowing for the system to make personalized recommendations to the user. However, there doesn't seem to be systems that recommend to more than one user, allowing for couples, families, groups of friends, to have personalized recommendations that take all of their preferences into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is notebook 3/4. This last notebook will cover some further model evaluation as well as the creation of function that allow for recommendations to be visible to the user. First, precision and recall are calculated for both models. Judging by the values that were returned, a hybrid approach seemed appropriate, so the ratings were averaged together to create hybrid predictions. These predictions were then used for the functions that recommended films to multiple users. The notebook also covers the creation of functions that allow for recommendations to new users, or users that we do not have predictions for."

    "The function below returns the top 15 films in the genre specified by the user. The top films are sorted by their number of votes from IMDB and their average rating from IMDB. Sorting by the number of votes first makes sure that we aren't recommending high scoring films that were rated by a very small number of people. Of course, in a real life scenario there would have to be caveats in place for newly released films. These films would not have as many votes as films that had been out for years, but would most likely end up being more popular at the time because they are \"new releases\". This was not an issue for this dataset, because the data was only collected up until 2015 and the vote and ratings came from newly updated files from the IMDB website, meaning that the films in this dataset had plently of time to accumulate ratings.<br>\n",
    "An option for future systems would be to have a \"top films of all time\" as well as a \"new releases\" category for each genre."

    "This system of searching for films and adding ratings one by one is very verbose and impractical. However, under the time constraints, it lays a nice base as a prototype for things to come. The function at this point also does not score the new ratings on the model. Another limitation of this function is the lack of processing that is involved on the input step. The user has to capitalize every word they type in and search by keyword only, because if the name of the film is not formatted exactly how it is in the reference dataframe, it will not show up. This can obviously be dealt with at a later date with some simple formatting issue work arounds."

    "As far as model selection goes, given more time, I would like to attempt to use the SVDpp. This model takes into account implicit ratings, which is the fact that a user rated a film in general, no matter what the rating is. However, this model is very computationally expensive and would take a very long time to run, so it will have to happen outside of the time constraints of this project. I also found that the recall scores for both models were much lower than I would have liked. When using the SVD alone, there was a lot of repeat recommendations on users top lists, no matter the combination of ids. Bringing the KNN predictions in, as well as thresholding for films above a certain vote count helped to tamper this issue. However, the issue is definitely not fixed completely and requires more investigation and most likely more in-depth model optimization. There are still many user combinations that return the same few films, especially when the thresholding for a minimum rating was put in to place. This shows just how important recall is in recommender systems. With low recall scores, you just end up recommending the same few films to everyone because they technically are relevant to all users because of their popularity. However, you miss out on a lot of the very user specific recommendations which is what would set apart a really great recommender. A system that finds the true key differences between users and does not just recommend films because they are generally well liked.<br>\n",
    "The user interface is completely non-existent, so I would ideally like to have it in a website or an app that allows the user to interact with something a bit more clean and less code based. At this point, I imagine only someone familiar with code would be able to understand how to call the functions, which is not ideal. Also, as mentioned I would like to have the new ratings input be a bit cleaner, and possibly offer a list of films for the user to rate instead of having them search. This way you could spread the films available over key points of difference so the models would be able to judge more accurately on less film choices.<br>\n",
    "The function created to find the top N films for each user is also quite memory intensive, since it stores all of the films above the threshold for each user. It would probably be a bit better to have the function calculate and store only the required amount of user information when the function is called. \n",
